# 🔧 General Settings

**🤖 Auto Buy:**

* Enable automatic purchases by sending a token mint as a message.
* **⚠️ Use with caution!** This feature will execute trades automatically based on your settings.

**✅ Confirm Trades:**

* Enable/disable confirmation prompts before executing any buy or sell order.
* This adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to manually confirm each transaction before it is processed.

**🐢 MEV Protection:**

* Reduce the risk of front-running bots by adding additional steps to trades.
* This optional feature can help safeguard your trades from malicious actors, but be aware that it may lead to slower execution times.

**💲 Min Pos Value:**

* Set the minimum USD value for token positions to appear in the Sell menu.
* This allows you to filter out smaller positions that might not be worth selling, keeping your Sell menu more streamlined.

**📈 Chart Previews:**

* Enable/disable previews for links with trading chart data (like Dexscreener).
* This provides you with a quick glimpse of the price chart for a token without having to leave Telegram.

With these general settings, you can tailor TurboTendies to match your individual trading preferences. Experiment with different settings to discover what works best for you!
