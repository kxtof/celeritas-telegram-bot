**ðŸ“ˆ Buy Slippage:**

* Slippage is the price difference you're willing to accept.
* A higher slippage increases the likelihood of your order being executed but might lead to less favorable prices.
* **Lower Slippage:**
  * May result in your order taking longer to execute.
  * More likely to get a better price.
* **Higher Slippage:**
  * May result in your order getting filled faster.
  * More likely to get a worse price.
  * **Example:**
    * You set a slippage of 5%.
    * The bot will execute the order if the price doesn't increase by more than 5%.

Set your preferred buy amounts and slippage for a more efficient trading experience. Remember, the right balance between price and speed depends on your trading strategy.
