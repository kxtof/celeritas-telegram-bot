**1. Access the Token Menu:**

* **Sell Menu:** You can access the sell menu directly through the main menu. Tap "Sell" and browse through your current token holdings.

**2. Choose Your Sell Options:**

* **Percentage to Sell:** Select a predetermined percentage to sell from your holdings, or...
  * **Choose Custom %:** Enter a custom percentage if your desired amount isn't in the pre-defined list.
* **Slippage:** Determine how much price fluctuation you're willing to accept.
* **Confirm Trades:** If you have enabled trade confirmations in your settings, the bot will ask you to confirm your sell order before it is executed. This provides an extra layer of security.

**3. Execute Your Sale:**

* **SELL Button:** Once you've chosen your sell options, tap "SELL" to initiate your order.
* **Tracking:** After submitting your order, the bot will provide a transaction link for you to track on Solscan.io.

**Key Points:**

* **Market Cap:** The market cap of the token is displayed to give you an idea of its overall value.
* **Price Change:** Shows the token's price change over different timeframes (5m, 30m, 24h).
* **Renounced:** Indicates whether the token's smart contract has been renounced, meaning no further changes can be made to the contract. (**If rugging is possible**)
* **Price Impact:** Estimates the potential impact of your sell order on the token's price.
* **Transaction Display:** Provides a visual breakdown of the estimated SOL output based on your chosen amount and slippage.
* **Confirmation:** The user must confirm the sale before it is executed.

**Tips:**

* **Balance Your Needs:** Find the right balance between selling speed and price optimization.
* **Research Before Trading:** Always do your own research on tokens before buying or selling them.
* **Use Slippage Wisely:** A higher slippage may result in faster execution, but a lower slippage can potentially fetch you a better price.
* **Confirmation is Your Friend:** Enabling trade confirmation is a good idea for extra security.
