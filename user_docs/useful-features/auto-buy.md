# ü§ñ Auto buy

**Auto Buy** is a powerful feature that lets you **purchase tokens automatically** simply by sending their **mint address** as a message. This can be a huge time-saver, allowing you to capitalize on opportunities quickly.

**Here's how it works:**

1. **Enable Auto Buy:** Toggle the "Auto Buy" button in your settings.
2. **Set Your Preferences:** Define the amount of SOL you'd like to spend per auto buy and the slippage you're willing to accept.
3. **Send the Mint:** Paste the token mint address into the chat, and TurboTendies will automatically execute the purchase based on your settings.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Use with caution!** Auto Buy executes trades automatically. Make sure your settings align with your trading strategy and risk tolerance. We recommend careful consideration before enabling this feature.

**Examples:**

* You enable Auto Buy with a buy amount of 1 SOL and 10% slippage.
* You send the mint address of a new token.
* If the current price of that token is doesn't increase by more than 10%, TurboTendies will execute the purchase automatically.

With Auto Buy, you'll never miss out on a new token launch or a price dip again. However, remember that speed comes with a trade-off, and using a higher slippage may result in a less favorable price. Trade smart and let TurboTendies be your trusted trading companion!
