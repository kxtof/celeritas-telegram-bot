# ðŸ’° Sell Settings

**ðŸ“Š Sell Percentages:**

* Set predetermined sell percentages of your holdings.
* This makes selling a specific percentage of your tokens quick and easy.
* Choose from three options:
* ðŸ”´ Low
* ðŸŸ¡ Medium
* ðŸŸ¢ High
* You can customize each percentage by clicking on the button next to it.

**ðŸ“‰ Sell Slippage:**

* **Slippage** is the maximum price difference you're willing to accept when selling your tokens.
* It's essentially the "cushion" you give the bot to ensure a smooth sale.
* **Lower Slippage:**
* May result in your order taking longer to execute, as the bot will wait for a more favourable price.
* **Higher Slippage:**
* Increases the likelihood of your order being filled quickly but might lead to a lower price than you expected.
* **Example:**
* You set a slippage of 10%.
* You want to sell a token for 1 SOL.
* The bot will execute the order if the price hasn't decreased by more than 10%.

By adjusting your sell percentages and slippage settings, you can balance your desire for speed and price optimization. Remember, finding the right combination depends on your individual trading strategy and risk tolerance.
