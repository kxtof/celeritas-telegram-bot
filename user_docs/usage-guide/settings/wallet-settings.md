# 👛 Wallet Settings

**💡 Options:**

* **Wallet Import ✏️:**
  * Import a new wallet using its secret key.
  * This action will completely replace your current wallet and its data, including your holdings, transactions, and settings.
  * **⚠️ Important:** Ensure you handle your secret key with extreme care! It's highly sensitive information, and losing it will result in losing access to your wallet and its funds.
* **Wallet Export 📤:**
  * Download your current wallet's secret key.
  * **⚠️ Danger:** Exporting your wallet removes its security guarantees and exposes your private key. It's strongly recommended to keep your secret key secure and only export it if absolutely necessary.

By importing and exporting your wallet, you can manage your funds across different wallets and maintain flexibility. However, remember to prioritize the safety of your secret key at all times!
